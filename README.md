This project combines bicycle and auto-traffic data to show the optimal path between two points and displays these routes on an implementation of Deck Gl, returning an analysis of comparative travel profiles for each mode of travel. The result is a static web page with a single JSON call. 

A few observations
(1) Cyclists and cars travel widely divergent paths in non-obvious ways, often traveling further distances to avoid elevation gain and dangerous road conditions
(2) For routes with major interstate auto traffic impedences <6 miles in length, bikes will be equal to or slightly faster than cars
(3) The feasibility of commuting 10-15 miles increases dramatically with the introduction of e-bikes into the commuting pool, reportedly increasing travel speeds by 2-3 mph and eliminating the need to avoid elevation gain
